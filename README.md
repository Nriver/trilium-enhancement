### Edited Note List

Moded from https://github.com/zadam/trilium/discussions/2670, thanks to wouterbatelaan-es!

### Change Clone Icon

Change note clone icon to DNA symbol with `sandy brown` color which displays clearly in both light theme and dark theme.

Default:

![](docs/clone-icon-default.webp)

Enhanced:

![](docs/clone-icon.webp)

## Action Enhancements

### Note Tree Scroll Bar

Default:

![](docs/note-tree-scroll-default.webp)

Enhanced:

![](docs/note-tree-scroll.webp)

From https://github.com/zadam/trilium/discussions/4706, thanks to SiriusXT

### New Note Button

Move the add note button to the front, in case the `horizontal scrollbar for note tree` makes the button go out of the panel. Also, the possibility of hitting the new note button by mistake is reduced.

Default:

![](docs/new-note-button-default.webp)

Enhanced:

![](docs/new-note-button.webp)

By Nriver

### Wide Quick Search

Quick search with no width limit. You can see everything now.

Default:

![](docs/search-bar-default.webp)

Enhanced:

![](docs/search-bar.webp)

It also works for the `@ option` which you can see in the previous screenshot.

# How to Install

1. Download the zip file from the [release page](https://github.com/Nriver/trilium-enhancement/releases).
2. Right-click the note tree in Trilium and click import, uncheck `Safe Import`.
3. Restart Trilium Notes or use `ctrl+r` to reload the interface.
4. Have fun.

# Hints

1. The screenshots are taken with [bing-daily-theme](https://github.com/Nriver/bing-daily-theme).
2. The colors are designed to work on most of the themes. You can tweak them if you want.
3. If you are using a light theme instead of a dark theme like I do, you may want to uncomment the CSS for the light theme in the `title background` note.

# Why I Made This?

Trilium is great. There are some little tweaks I can do to make it greater. And here we are.
